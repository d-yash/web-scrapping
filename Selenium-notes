from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys				-> for key strokes like keys.RETURN for using enter key
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By					-> used for selector like By.CLASS_NAME etc
import time													-> time package



driver = webdriver.Chrome()				-> webdriver.<<Browser>>() 

SELENIUM code needs to wrapped between this two

watch_name = driver.find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME, "WKTcLC")
